Once the solution is imported add the data files to the cloud server by following the Getting Started with TigerGraph 3.0 blog. The last step is to install the default queries that came with the starter kit. These instruction are also in the blog mentioned above.\n",

    "#### PageRank\n",
    "**Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "The PageRank algorithm measures the influence of each vertex on every other vertex. PageRank influence is defined recursively: a vertex's influence is based on the influence of the vertices which refer to it. A vertex's influence tends to increase if (1) it has more referring vertices or if (2) its referring vertices have higher influence. The analogy to social influence is clear.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Label Propagation\n",
    "**Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Propagation is a heuristic method for determining communities.  The idea is simple: If the plurality of your neighbors all bear the label X, then you should label yourself as also a member of X. The algorithm begins with each vertex having its own unique label. Then we iteratively update labels based on the neighbor influence described above. It is important that the order for updating the vertices be random. The algorithm is favored for its efficiency and simplicity, but it is not guaranteed to produce the same results every time.\n",
    "In a variant version, some vertices could initially be known to belong to the same community. If they are well-connected to one another, they are likely to preserve their common membership and influence their neighbors,\n",
